# passionfruit

Web app that allows people to explore passions. For PioneerHacks III. :/

## Dev Notes
- /src contains files for frontend in the react-app
- /pydata contains scripts for web scrapping and data analysis (supposedly)
- /scratch folder is ignored in .gitignore so can be used for testing without destroying the commit history

## TODOs
- [x] web scraping Wikipedia for list of hobbies
- [ ] manipulate data into a readable format for js
- [ ] build frontend UI/UX with graph of connected nodes (static site)
- [ ] give nodes an interface to link to other resources like wiki
- [ ] add data on firebase for js to request
- [ ] deploy site on firebase
- [ ] add animations, icons, colors, styling, about page
